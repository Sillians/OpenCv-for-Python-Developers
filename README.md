# OpenCv-for-Python-Developers
An introduction to OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library)  an open source computer vision and machine learning software library. 


OpenCV is an open-source toolkit for advanced computer vision. It is one of the most popular tools for facial recognition, used in a wide variety of security, marketing, and photography applications, and it powers a lot of cutting-edge tech, including augmented reality and robotics. 

This Repo offers Python developers a detailed introduction to OpenCV 3, starting with data and image types unique to OpenCV, and how to manipulate pixels and images. It also shows how to read video streams as inputs, and create custom real-time video interfaces. Then comes the real power of OpenCV: object, facial, and feature detection. How to leverage the image-processing power of OpenCV using methods like template matching and machine learning data to identify and recognize features.
